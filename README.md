**#Hi, My name is Palwasha 👋**


## Sofware Engineer

Born and raised in Pakistan, but I've been living and breathing code ever since I tried my first HELLO WORLD print. I have graduated from CEME in Computer Engineering at [National University Of Science and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk "National University Of Science and Technology"), and my true passion is in software development. I've been coding up a storm and loving every minute of it. I'm currently based in Pakistan, where I'm living my best life as a self-taught, passionate software engineer.

🌍  I'm based in Lahore, Pakistan
